                <h3>Encryption and Secure Transmission</h3>
                <p>All data transmitted between your device and our servers is protected using advanced 256-bit SSL encryption technology. This military-grade encryption ensures that your personal information, financial details, and gaming data remain secure during transmission and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.</p>

                <p>Our secure data centers utilize multiple layers of physical and digital security, including biometric access controls, 24/7 monitoring, and redundant backup systems. We maintain strict access controls ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information, and all access is logged and monitored.</p>

                <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
                <p>Personal data is stored on secure servers located in jurisdictions with strong data protection laws. We maintain comprehensive backup systems to prevent data loss while ensuring that all stored information remains encrypted and protected against unauthorized access.</p>

                <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, and maintain accurate records for regulatory purposes. Account information is typically retained for a minimum period required by gaming regulations, after which it is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Data Sharing</h3>
                <p>Laser247 does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

We conduct regular audits of our partners to ensure compliance with our privacy standards and applicable data protection regulations.</p>

                <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
                <p>As a licensed gaming operator, we are required to share certain information with regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and financial intelligence units when legally obligated. This includes reporting suspicious transactions, providing audit information, and complying with anti-money laundering requirements.</p>

                <p>We maintain detailed records of all data sharing activities and ensure that any information disclosed is limited to what is specifically required by law or regulation. Users are notified of such disclosures when legally permissible and practically possible.</p>

                <h3>User Rights and Control</h3>
                <p>You have comprehensive rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your information. You can review and modify most account information through your user dashboard or by contacting our customer support team.</p>

                <p>You may also request a complete copy of your personal data, object to certain types of data processing, or request data portability where technically feasible. We respond to all legitimate requests within the timeframes required by applicable privacy laws.</p>

                <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
