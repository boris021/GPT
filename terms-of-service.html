                    Last updated: January 15, 2025. These Terms of Service govern your use of Laser247 gaming platform. By creating an account or using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

                <div class="warning-box-site-043">
                    <h3>Minimum Age Requirement</h3>
                    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Laser247 services. In jurisdictions where the legal gambling age is higher than 18, you must meet that minimum age requirement. Underage gambling is strictly prohibited and illegal.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Legal Age Verification</h3>
                <p>All users must provide valid government-issued identification to verify their age and identity before accessing gaming services. We employ sophisticated age verification systems and reserve the right to request additional documentation at any time to confirm eligibility.</p>

                <p>Users who attempt to circumvent age verification measures or provide false information will have their accounts permanently closed, and any funds may be forfeited. We maintain strict policies to prevent underage access to gambling services and comply with all applicable laws regarding age restrictions.</p>

                <h3>Jurisdictional Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Gaming services are only available to residents of jurisdictions where online gambling is legal and regulated. Users are responsible for understanding and complying with local laws regarding online gambling in their jurisdiction of residence.</p>

                <p>Laser247 reserves the right to restrict access from certain territories based on legal requirements, licensing conditions, or business decisions. Users traveling to restricted jurisdictions may find their account access temporarily limited until they return to an eligible location.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Must be 18+ years old (or legal gambling age in your jurisdiction)</li>
                    <li>Must provide valid government-issued photo identification</li>
                    <li>Must be legally eligible to gamble in your jurisdiction</li>
                    <li>Must not be on any gambling exclusion lists</li>
                    <li>Must have legal capacity to enter into binding agreements</li>

                <h2 id="responsible-play">Responsible Gaming and Player Protection</h2>
                
                <h3>Commitment to Responsible Gaming</h3>
                <p>Laser247 is committed to promoting responsible gaming practices and protecting vulnerable players. We provide comprehensive tools and resources to help users maintain control over their gaming activities and recognize potential signs of problem gambling.</p>

                <p>Our platform includes various responsible gaming features such as deposit limits, session time limits, reality checks, and self-exclusion options. These tools are designed to empower players to make informed decisions about their gaming behavior and maintain healthy gambling habits.</p>

                <h3>Deposit and Spending Limits</h3>
                <p>Users can set daily, weekly, and monthly deposit limits to control their spending. Once set, these limits can only be increased after a cooling-off period, while decreases take effect immediately. We also provide loss limits and wagering limits to help players manage their overall gaming activity.</p>

                <p>Session time limits and reality checks remind players of how long they have been gaming, encouraging regular breaks and reflection on gaming behavior. These features can be customized based on individual preferences and needs.</p>

                <div class="info-box-site-043">
                    <h3>Self-Exclusion Options</h3>
                    <p>Players can self-exclude from Laser247 for periods ranging from 24 hours to permanently. During self-exclusion, access to the account is blocked, and no promotional materials are sent. Professional support resources are available for players seeking help with gambling-related issues.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Problem Gambling Support</h3>
                <p>We partner with leading organizations that provide support for problem gambling, including counseling services, support groups, and educational resources. Our customer support team is trained to recognize signs of problem gambling and can provide information about available help options.</p>

                <p>Players concerned about their gambling behavior can contact our support team for assistance in accessing appropriate resources and implementing protective measures on their account. All such communications are handled with complete confidentiality and respect.</p>

                <h3>Underage Gambling Prevention</h3>

Any suspected underage gambling is immediately investigated and reported to appropriate authorities.</p>

                <h2 id="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction and Legal Compliance</h2>
                
                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms of Service are governed by the laws of Gibraltar, where Laser247 Gaming Ltd. is licensed and regulated. Any disputes arising from the use of our services will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Gibraltar courts unless otherwise specified by mandatory local law.</p>

                <p>Users agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of Gibraltar courts for the resolution of any disputes. However, Laser247 may pursue legal action in the courts of the user's jurisdiction for debt collection or enforcement of these terms.</p>

                <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
                <p>Laser247 operates under licenses issued by the Gibraltar Gambling Commission and other relevant regulatory authorities. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance and undergo regular audits to ensure continued adherence to licensing requirements.</p>

                <p>Users are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction, including tax obligations related to gambling winnings. Laser247 may be required to report certain information to regulatory authorities or tax agencies as mandated by law.</p>

                <h3>Anti-Money Laundering Measures</h3>
                <p>As a licensed gaming operator, Laser247 maintains comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Users may be required to provide additional documentation and information to verify their identity, source of funds, and compliance with AML regulations.</p>

                <p>Suspicious transactions are monitored and reported to relevant financial intelligence units as required by law. Accounts may be frozen or closed if suspicious activity is detected, and funds may be held pending investigation by appropriate authorities.</p>

                <h3>International Sanctions Compliance</h3>
                <p>Laser247 complies with international sanctions laws and regulations, including those imposed by the United Nations, European Union, United States, and United Kingdom. We screen all users against sanctions lists and may be required to freeze accounts or report activities related to sanctioned individuals or entities.</p>

                <h2 id="liability">Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
                
                <h3>Service Availability</h3>
                <p>While Laser247 strives to provide continuous service availability, we cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to our platform. Scheduled maintenance, technical issues, or force majeure events may result in temporary service disruptions.</p>

                <p>Users acknowledge that temporary service interruptions may occur and agree that Laser247 shall not be liable for any losses resulting from such interruptions, except where required by applicable consumer protection laws.</p>

                <h3>Game Fairness and Random Number Generation</h3>
                <p>All games on the Laser247 platform utilize certified random number generators (RNGs) to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes. RNGs are regularly tested by independent auditing firms to verify their integrity and compliance with industry standards.</p>

                <p>While we ensure game fairness through certified systems, gambling inherently involves risk, and users acknowledge that losses are possible. Past results do not guarantee future outcomes, and all gaming should be approached as entertainment rather than a source of income.</p>

                <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>Laser247's liability to users is limited to the extent permitted by applicable law. In no event shall our total liability exceed the amount deposited by the user in their account during the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

                <p>We shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

                <div class="warning-box-site-043">
                    <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
                    <p>Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their account credentials, understanding the risks associated with gambling, and complying with all applicable laws. Laser247 is not liable for losses resulting from unauthorized account access due to user negligence.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
                <p>Laser247 shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, strikes, technical failures, or government actions.</p>

                <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
                <p>We encourage users to contact our customer support team to resolve any disputes informally before pursuing formal legal action. Most issues can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily through direct communication with our support staff.</p>

                <p>For disputes that cannot be resolved through customer support, users may access alternative dispute resolution services or pursue remedies through appropriate courts as outlined in these terms. We are committed to fair and transparent dispute resolution processes.</p>

                <h3>Modifications to Terms</h3>
                <p>Laser247 reserves the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time to reflect changes in our services, applicable laws, or business requirements. Material changes will be communicated to users through email notification or prominent website notices.</p>

                <p>Continued use of our services after notification of changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. Users who do not agree to changes may close their account in accordance with our account closure procedures.</p>
